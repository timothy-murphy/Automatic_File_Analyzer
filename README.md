# Automatic_File_Analyzer
This project was originally an assesment for a class. I completed the basic functionality and then spent the next few weeks tinkering with the project. 

The goal of the assesment was to create an automatic and scalable solution for a fictional energy company. The company wanted to measure the Kilowat output of various
factories on it network, including the Total kilowats, average kilowats, and then by square footage of the factory. 

The files are distinguished and found by the regex *2017.csv as it selects all files with the ending of 2017.csv
